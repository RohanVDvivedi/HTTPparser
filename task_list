 * build a function to get its q value

 * check if path matches regex containing only *, after it is split by "/" by using ` for_each_split_by_delim(split, &str, &delim) `

 * implement stream to read/write websocket data

   * application/x-www-form-urlencoded => read function returns 1 pair of dstrings key and value, write function writes 1 key value pair to stream, it takes a flag to tell if this is the first key_value_pair, use encoding just like we used it in http_path_and_path_params
   * multipart/form-data => ponder how to implement this

 * add cookie struct and a function to parse it and serialize it, its values are separated by ";"

 * write a function to initialize zlib_streams from ConnMan based on the http headers
