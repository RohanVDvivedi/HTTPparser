 * implement stream to read/write websocket data

 * parser for reading and writing form data
   * multipart/form-data => to read this we need to first parse headers, so segregate function to parse headers, and then write a function to identify boundary, use ConnMan to read until a given dstring is hit (possible only after ConnMan developments), write a function to write a headers and then key value pair to stream, value being a dstring or a read stream to write from.

 * add cookie struct and a function to parse it and serialize it, its values are separated by ";"

 * write a function to initialize zlib_streams from ConnMan based on the http headers
