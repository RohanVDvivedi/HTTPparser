 * if memory allocation in parser fails then return NULL object and error code, but do not kill the process
 * in header_util.c outputs of parse acceptable values needs to be destroyed, OR initialize it as pointing to dstring
 * in http_multipart_form_data.c, read_prefix_multipart_form_data must take error as input parameter and fail if it could not allocate memory for __boundary, also check other places where this allocation passed unchecked
 * also check for init_dmap, init_http_request_head, init_http_response_head, in all files, fauilures must be handled
 * uri may only be parsed, and we do not need a separate initialize function for it
 * after above chenages ensure that Serc and other dependant libs are updated with the new api

 * implement stream to read/write websocket data -> you can test this with https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester client, after integration with Serc on serc-template-application
 * implement stream to read write server sent event data
