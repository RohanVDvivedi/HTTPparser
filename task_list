 * add struct header{ dstring value; dmap attributes(semicolon separated)} and a function to parse one_on_one or many_on_one (comma separated) headers from a line and a function to serialize it by similar 2 functions
 * the parse function returns array of the headers

 * write a function to initialize stream from ConnMan based on the http headers, for zlib and brotli compression (* do brotli later after it has been implemented in ConnMan)
 * test above task with available test cases test.c and test_c.c

 * integrate this library with serc

 * implement stream to read/write websocket data
  * you can test this with https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester client, after integration with Serc on serc-template-application

 * parser for reading and writing form data
   * multipart/form-data 
    * write a stream reader and writer, for form data that reads until boundary
